# Silly Web Paige [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dac6e4c7-c51a-4ed1-a7d7-9d4b82f3320f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sillywebpaige/deploys)

## Description

This react application is my new portfolio! I plan to use this portfolio as my professional portfolio (unless I make an even better one!) But I plan to add even more react-effects as well as refactor and further style as my skills grow and develop. This application is built with React and styled with Bootstrap. It uses React Router to handle the client side routing between the different pages of the website.

## Installation

If you so choose to install this application and play with the code, first download the repository and open in your preferred code editor. Run `npm install` to download the necessary npm package dependencies, found in the package.json. Finally, run the application from your local device by running the command `npm run dev`.

## Usage

The application can be reached at the deployed site [here](https://bestwebpaige.netlify.app/). You can navigate to all the pages via the links in the navbar and learn about me as a developer and person throughout the application.
